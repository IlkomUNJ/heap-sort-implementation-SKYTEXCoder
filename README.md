# How to Compile and Run My Submission Source Code (C++ Instructions)

## Pre-Requisites

- Git
- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher (e.g., `g++` or `clang++`).
- Optionally, CMake (if using a build system).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Compiling Directly With G++**

1. **Clone this specific fork:**

    Open a terminal of your own choice and run the following commands in order:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IlkomUNJ/heap-sort-implementation-SKYTEXCoder.git
    cd heap-sort-implementation-SKYTEXCoder
    ```

2. **Compile the source code:**

    Using that same terminal, run:

    ```bash
    cd src
    g++ -std=c++17 -o {desired_compiled_executable_name} main.cpp Heap.cpp
    ```

    Replace {desired_executable_name} with a relatively simple, easy to remember, and short name that you're comfortable with, e.g. "main", "submission", or "heap_program"

3. **Run the compiled executable:**

    Finally, using a terminal that's already navigated into within the src/ directory, run the following terminal commands to run the compiled executable:

    ```bash
    ./{desired_executable_name}
    ```

    Don't forget to replace {desired_executable_name} with the name that you gave the program to in the previous step before this one.
